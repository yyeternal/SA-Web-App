# 1. Introduction

The purpose of this document is to create a skeleton for the project so we know what basic templates and database tables to have in the project. We establish all of the relations for different tables in this document so when we begin to code, we already understand how the different classes interact. This will create a more efficient system when we begin to start coding. This is what our final product plan is, so it is an example for what our final product should look like so we can work to create a similar product. 

# 2. Software Design
This section describes how our final software product will operate and how the user will interact with it.

## 2.1 Database Model

1. User: abstract class that stores the common information for instructor and student.
2. Student: stores information for each system such as GPA, experience, and graduation date.
3. Instructor: stores information for each instructor such as the course sections they are teaching to allow for them to create SA positions
4. Course: stores information on each course offered in the CS department such course number and name.
5. Course section: stores information for a specific course such as when the course is offered and the section name
6. SA Position: stores information for the position the instructor created which specifies requirements such as minimum GPA and the number of SA positons available
7. SA Application: stores information for the application a Student submitted such as their grade in the class and year they took the class.

## 2.2 Subsystems and Interfaces

### 2.2.1 Overview

Describe the high-level architecture of your software:  i.e., the major subsystems and how they fit together. Provide a UML component diagram that illustrates the architecture of your software. Briefly mention the role of each subsystem in your architectural design. Please refer to the "System Level Design" lectures in Week 4. 
Our software will be composed of three major subsystems: main, auth, and errors. The errors subsystem will only be used for handling errors in routing and requests. The auth subsystem will handle all authorization tasks such as registering a new user, logging in and out, and keeping the forms for each of those. Most everything that will not be handled by the errors and auth subsystems will be handled by the main subsystem including courses, positions, applications, etc.

### 2.2.2 Interfaces

Include a detailed description of the routes your application will implement. 
* Brainstorm with your team members and identify all routes you need to implement for the **completed** application.
* For each route specify its “methods”, “URL path”, and “a description of the operation it implements”.  
* You can use the following table template to list your route specifications. 
* Organize this section according to your subsytem decomposition, i.e., include a sub-section for each subsytem and list all routes for that sub-section in a table.
