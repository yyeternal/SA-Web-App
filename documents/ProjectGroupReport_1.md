## 2. Iteration 1 - Summary

 We were able to accomplish registration for both instructor and student as well as login for both instructor and student. Additionally, there is a logout option for when a user is logged in. Instructors are now able to create course sections for courses they want SAs for as well as create SA positions for the course sections they have created. We also created the basis for our database going forward.

 * As a student, I want to be able to view all of the important information about the position to see if I am available and willing to SA this class. 
 * As a student, I want to be able to apply for multiple SA positions with my academic information in order to potentially get the role. 
 * As an instructor, I want to view all of the SA applications related to my course sections. 
 * As an instructor, I want to be able to view the students who have applied to the position to see how many have applied for this course. 
 * As an instructor, I want to be able to view if a student has already been assigned to a different course to determine if they would have enough time to SA my course.
