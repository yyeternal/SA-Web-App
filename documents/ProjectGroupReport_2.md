## 1. Iteration 2 - Summary

 For iteration 2, we were able to create the view positions from the student side as well as view SA positions from the instructor side. Additionally, we added custom validators so there are no errors on registration from the student and instructor side. We also added edit profile for student and instructors. Lastly, we added the ability for a student to apply for an SA position as well as for instructors to view what students applied for each SA position.

## 2. Iteration 2 - Sprint Retrospective

Iteration went alright, we had some issues with the instructor side of the app, but it was resolved through group effort. Iteration did not have a ton of work so it was difficult to assign equal amounts of work. For the next iteration, we will start working on it over Thanksgiving break.

## 3. Product Backlog refinement

 We slightly changed the relationships for application, enrollments, Sa position, and students.

As a student, I want to be able to view my application status so I can know if I have been accepted.
As a student, I want to be able to withdraw my application if I no longer want to be an SA for that class.
As an instructor, I want to be able to view each studentâ€™s qualifications to see who meets the requirements for the position.
As an instructor, I would like the option to add an SA applicant to an SA position. It is worth noting that an SA can only SA in one class.
